\chapter{Guidelines on the preparation of theses} \label{ch-1}

Please refer to \url{https://groups.oist.jp/grad/academic-program-policies} for specifications.

Many of the formatting requirements such as page size, fonts, etc are built-in into this template. Do not modify them.

For the bibliography, we recommend using BibTeX or BibLaTeX and through the file \texttt{Preamble/Thesis\_bibliography.bib}. Citing one reference can be done like so: \cite{Lee98} and multiple references in one go like so \cite{Fil09, Muc10, Kra27}.
